#if volume not mapped correctly, provide the full path
#depends_on: unless the dependent images gets pulled executed and started, the image wont start
#if not all the images will run in parallel and there could be a synchronization problem. If my hub container starts late and node starts early, there is a possibility that node and hub donâ€™t get connected
#HUB_HOST: either use this or create a docker private network
